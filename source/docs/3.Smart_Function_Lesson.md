# 3. Smart Function Lesson

## 3.1 Intelligent Line Following

### 3.1.1 Preparation

(1) Connect 4-ch line follower to the port shown on below picture (Port No.4 of expansion board).

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_1/image2.png" class="common_img" width="500px" />

(2) Prepare a black line, not too wide.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_1/image3.png" class="common_img" width="500px"/>

### 3.1.2 Learning Objective

(1) Learn about the principle of 4-ch line follower and corresponding coding blocks.

(2) Program Qtruck to move along black line.

### 3.1.3 Project Logic

Use 4-channel line follower sensor to detect black and white lines, which enable Qtruck move along black line.

The sensor has four sensing units, and each unit includes an infrared emitter and an infrared receiver. If the infrared light is reflected, for example when it encounters a white or other light-colored surface, the receiver will receive the infrared signal, and you will see the corresponding blue LED indicator light up on the back of the line follower sensor. If the infrared light is absorbed or cannot be reflected, the receiver will not receive any signal.

If you find that line following does not work properly during use, you can adjust the sensor sensitivity with a screwdriver. Turning clockwise will increase the sensitivity, while turning counterclockwise will decrease it.

## 3.3 Intelligent Voice Control

### 3.3.1 Preparation

(1) The location of the sound sensor on the Qtruck robot.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_3/image2.png" class="common_img" width="500px" />

(2) The distribution and placement of the servos on the Qtruck.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_3/image3.jpg" class="common_img" width="700px" />

(3) Prepare a small block.

### 3.3.2 Learning Objective

(1) Gain a basic understanding of the sound sensor and servos.

(2) Learn how to use logic instruction blocks.

(3) Program the Qtruck robot to grab objects upon hearing a sound.

### 3.3.3 Project Logic

Qtruck is equipped with a sound sensor that can detect sound volume levels. By programming, we control the three servos on the robotic arm to perform a grabbing action.

The sound sensor functions similarly to a microphone. It is used to receive sound waves, but it cannot be used to measure noise intensity.

A servo can precisely control the rotation angle of its horn, which is why it is often used in mechanical systems that require high accuracy. A servo typically consists of a motor, control circuit board, gear set, and potentiometer.

Insert the micro:bit controller into the computer separately, download the program, and then insert it into the expansion board. After turning on the switch, you can control the robotic arm by clapping your hands. When you clap once, the robotic arm will pick up the block placed in front of it.

## 3.4 Grab in a Certain Distance

### 3.4.1 Preparation

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_4/image2.png" class="common_img" width="600px" />

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_4/image3.png" class="common_img" />

(2) The position of servos on Qtruck.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_3/image3.jpg" class="common_img" width="500px" />

(3) Prepare a square block.

### 3.4.2 Learning Objective

(1) Learn about the principle of ultrasonic sensor.

(2) Learn about the coding block related to ultrasonic sensor.

(3) Enable Qtruck to grab object in a certain distance through programming.

### 3.4.3 Project Logic

The ultrasonic sensor is used to measure distance, and the position of the object in front is determined through programming. If the conditions are met, the robotic arm will proceed to pick up the object.

The ultrasonic sensor is equipped with two transducers, one for transmitting and one for receiving ultrasonic waves. When measuring distance, the module automatically emits eight 40 kHz square wave pulses to detect whether an echo is returned. If an echo is detected, the sensor outputs a high-level signal. The duration of this high-level signal corresponds to the time it takes for the ultrasonic waves to travel to the object and bounce back.

Formula: measured distance = (the duration of high level * sound velocity (`340M/S`)) / `2`
