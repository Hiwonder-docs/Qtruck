### 4.2.1 Introduction to microbit V2.0

Based on the original function of micro:bit V1.5, the new generation of micro:bit V2.0 has been optimized and improved in computing power and performance, as well as add several onboard modules for expansion.

All functions of micro:bit V1.5 can be implemented in micro:bit V2. Therefore, the tutorial for micro:bit V1.5 is applicable to micro:bit V2.0.

Regarding the new features of micro:bit V2.0, please see the related lessons.

The following table shows the comparison between two boards and the red parts highlights the new function of micro:bit V2.0.
